This console application takes two files as input:
1) A list of words to be used as a dictionary.
2) A grid of letters with hidden words in eight directions.

The application searches the grid against the dictionary file,
then outputs any words that are found, the grid coordinate where
that word begins, and the direction that word is hidden.
